# pokedex

I did this project while in training at my current job. It's purpose was to help me begin to understand how to use apis to get data from the web and use it in an application. It obviously is not the best way to do what it does, but it was a fun little project.

You can run it using `mvn spring-boot:run` when in the root directory, and hit the service at localhost.
